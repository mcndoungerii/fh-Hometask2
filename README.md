Registration (Matriculation) number: 7219535

Description:
In this code, we create a Car class with properties such as id, make, model, yearOfManufacture, color, price, and registrationNumber. 

We then have methods to filter and save cars based on the specified criteria: 
brand (i.e., saveCarsByBrand), 
model and age (i.e., saveCarsByModelAndAge), 
year of manufacture and price (i.e., saveCarsByYearAndPrice). 

The saveToFile method is used to save the filtered cars to separate text files.
For instance:
	CarsByBrand_Mercedes-Benz.txt, 
	CarsByModelAndAge_Golf_3_Years.txt, 
	CarsByYearAndPrice_2018_PriceAbove_18000.0.txt
